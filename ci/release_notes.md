# New Features

`spruce` now accumulates all errors with your templates, and spits them out all at once,
to reduce churn when fixing large numbers of problems. This may not sound like much,
but it's a huge time saver.

# Bug Fixes

None!

# Acknowledgements

The error aggregation feature was implemented by [James Hunt](https://github.com/filefrog)
and you should thank him for that!
