# New features

Thanks to @HeavyWombat and @Dargmeuesli, we now have a docker image for spruce! It's
built for every master commit as the `latest` tag, with versioned release tags for each
official release of spruce (e.g. `geofffranks/spruce:v1.19.2`)

# Fixes

Bumped the version of go-patch being used in spruce, to resolve issues like #283, thanks
for catching this @andrew-edgar!
