# New Features

- Thanks to @jszroberto there is now a `--no-eval` option
  for spruce merging! This lets you merge things together, but
  skip evaluation of all operators. Useful for using spruce
  to build spruce templates that something else will later
  evaluate.

# Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `spruce help` was broken due to the new `diff`
  command.
