# New Features

- ` (( load "FILENAME" ))` has been added. The `load` operator will load the contents of a YAML file,
  into the datastructure where it was invoked. See the [docs|https://github.com/geofffranks/spruce/blob/master/doc/operators.md#-load-]

# Acknowledgements

Many thanks to @HeavyWombat for the `load` operator!
